# Releasing

This is a guide for maintainers.

Releasing a new version follows the [standardized workflow](https://stylelint.io/maintainer-guide/releases) across the Stylelint organization.

In short, the steps are:

1. Trigger the `release-pr` workflow to create a release PR.
2. Review and merge the created release PR. Publishing will be started automatically.
3. Confirm that the new version is available on [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint).
4. Publish a new [GitHub release](https://github.com/stylelint/vscode-stylelint/releases).

That's all.
